#Welcome to Community Code

This is a repo where you can submit anything code related, hopefully specifically related to open source software (OSS), and the company friends listed below will help get the word out weekly via whatever digital microphones they see fit (or subscribe to our Blog/RSS feed at [here](http://omgdogs.com) (will be a blog at opensourceshowandtell.github.io/blog)). This isn't limited to things our company friends are specifically interested in, so post just about anything you think might interest other humans, it's is a way to get the word out about interesting things happening in our community. We reserve the right to not post everything submitted and will filter/decline submissions that are offensive, seem to promote biz dev, are looking for PR, are trying to encourage recruiting, or are largely an opinion piece.

Please keep content respectful and appropriate. If you have any questions about what may or may not be appropriate please visit our [code of conduct](https://github.com/OpenSourceShowAndTell/code-of-conduct) or reach out and someone will respond to your question/s.
